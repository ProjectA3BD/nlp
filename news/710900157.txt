"The fact is that doing business as usual does not take us even close to where we need to go," Rasmussen said.

Denmark, along with Chile, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Korea, Mexico and Vietnam, launched the Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) during the UN General Assembly in New York in September.

P4G aims to speed up progress and deliver concrete results on the SDGs with a focus on "innovative public-private partnerships," particularly by unlocking private investments into green growth, covering energy, water, land-use, food, sustainable cities and a circular economy.

Rasmussen, who extended an invitation to President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo to attend the inaugural P4G Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, next November during the leaders' bilateral meeting on Tuesday, said that Indonesia "is willing to engage in P4G."

"Indonesia can use P4G as a platform to kick-start public-private partnerships that will create more jobs, generate affordable energy and improve the environment," Rasmussen said.

The Indonesian government has been active in its efforts to achieve and mainstream the SDGs, including by incorporating the goals within the country's own development schemes.

The Danish prime minister is visiting Indonesia from Nov. 27 to 29. He held a bilateral meeting with Jokowi on Tuesday, where the two leaders agreed to strengthen cooperation across various areas, including waste management and energy.

They also signed an action plan for an Indonesia-Denmark 2017-2020 partnership during the occasion.
