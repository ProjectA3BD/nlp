"The US has a lot of influence over geopolitics and the global economy. A good country should be able to anticipate any [economic] crisis that might be coming out of the US," Sri Mulyani said.

"One thing we can do is to keep our domestic demand strong," she added.

To overcome recent global economic slowdown, Sri Mulyani said the government has been focusing on strengthening three main sectors: human resource investment, infrastructure development and bureaucratic reform.

Education is the best investment

The 54-year-old Sri Mulyani initiated LPDP during her first stint as finance minister in 2005-2010 under former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Until today, LPDP is still managed by the Finance Ministry.

LPDP recipients get full backing from the government to earn post-graduate degrees in both local and overseas universities.

"Education is one of the most important elements in developing a country. It's one of the most important requirements for a healthy economy. How good a country is doing can be seen in the quality of its education," she said.
