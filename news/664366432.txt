[JAKARTA] Indonesia's government reached a settlement with Alphabet Inc's Google over a long-running tax dispute, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said.

Ms Indrawati told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday that there was "an agreement with them based on 2016, but we can't disclose the figure".

She declined to provide further details. Representatives for Google in Indonesia weren't available to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.

Officials said last year Google owed about five trillion rupiah (S$520.85 million) in taxes and penalties for 2015, while documents show the company paid 5.2 billion rupiah in taxes.

Ms Indrawati, who took office last year, has made it a priority to boost tax revenue to relieve pressure on the budget and is targeting other technology giants, such as Apple Inc, Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc.
