[JAKARTA] Indonesia's government will rely on tax audits, especially for individuals, this year if the parliament rejects a tax amnesty bill, the finance minister said on Tuesday.

Parliament delayed discussion on the tax amnesty bill until after it returns from a recess in April, and many political watchers say the bill may face a long political debate.

"We will optimize the audit on individual taxpayers ... The tax office will be looking at tax reports from individuals on whether their payments match their wealth," Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro told reporters.

"If the tax amnesty could be done, the audit probably wouldn't be as strict," he added.
