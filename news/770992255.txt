DUBLIN, July 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --

The "Indonesia High Speed Diesel Genset Market (2018-2024): Market Forecast By kVA Rating (5 kVA-500 kVA, 501 kVA-1000 kVA and 1001 kVA-3000 kVA), By Types (Standby and Continuous/Prime), By Applications, By Regions and Competitive Landscape" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Indonesia High Speed Diesel Genset Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.8% during 2018-24 on account of the expansion of the industrial sector, rising number of small and medium-sized businesses as well as development of social infrastructure in various regions.



Indonesia's GDP is estimated to register significant growth in 2018 due to the development of agro-based industries. Additionally, low cost manufacturing coupled with favorable government policies would act as a catalyst for various industries in the country and will significantly drive the demand for high speed diesel genset market during the forecast period.



In Indonesia, high speed diesel gensets with rating 5 kVA-500 kVA accounted for the majority of the revenue and volume share due to wide range of applications across various sectors. High utilization of these gensets in telecom infrastructure in the unreliable and off-grid regions is also expected to drive the market by 2024.

By application types, commercial application accounted for majority of the revenue share in the overall market, followed by industrial and residential applications. However, during the forecast period, the industrial application is expected to depict highest growth rate due to the development of large-scale industrial projects such as construction of new special zones in Bitung and Morotai, which would be responsible for the growth of high speed diesel genset market over the coming years.



By regions, Java region captured the largest revenue share followed by Sumatra region and is anticipated to maintain its dominance over the coming years due to upcoming industrial parks in East, Central and West Java region, which would require installation of new high speed diesel gensets in the region.
