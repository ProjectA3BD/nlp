Airbnb has changed the way many people travel, including billionaires.

Renting private villas has become increasingly popular among the world’s richest people, according to Nota Bene Global.

Airbnb-style luxury villa rentals cost between $87,000 and $174,000 per week.

Airbnb has changed the way many people travel, including billionaires.

Just ask Anthony Lassman, cofounder of London-based, luxury travel- and lifestyle-management company Nota Bene Global. Lassman and his wife Elaine have been offering tailor-made, travel-planning services to the ultra-high net worth crowd since launching Nota Bene in 2005.

“Ten to $20 million is the starting wealth [of our clients],” Lassman told Business Insider. “Some of them I know are worth between $1.5 to $8 billion,” he said.

For billionaires, the relative cost of a trip to Bali is like buying a candy bar. But that doesn’t mean they’re flippant about how they spend their money.

Lassman says his clients “will pay it if they believe it’s something very, very, extraordinary.”

That’s why more than ever, Lassman is putting his millionaire and billionaire clientele into private rented villas – a type of Airbnb for billionaires – noting that the privacy and true relaxation is worth the extremely high prices.

Luxury vacation rentals in destinations like Greece and Italy typically cost between $87,155 to $174,349 per week.

For Lassman, whose company previews all the villas before offering them as an option to his clients, it’s all about the quality. “Nobody wants their money to be taken for granted. Nobody wants to feel you’re just billing them for huge sums of money without being able to justify it.”

Ahead, a look at a few truly stunning, remote villas that you won’t find on Airbnb – and that only the super rich can afford to rent out.

“The finest villas, and [most] interest in villa rentals at the moment [are] the Greek Islands. [We rent] the top houses on the Greek islands. [We have] the very best on Mykonos,” said Lassman.

Lassman also noted the growing popularity of Mykonos: “Although, Mykonos is becoming a little too trendy and exploited.” He’s been suggesting his clients visit an entirely private island, or the island of Antiparos.
