"I think [the 35,000 MW] will be finished before 2024, maybe in 2021," he said.

Indonesia electrification ratio — or the percentage of Indonesian households connected to the electricity grid — would increase to at least 95 percent in 2019 from today's 88 percent, he said.

Jonan said the ministry is preparing several regulations to spur the electrification ratio which will allow private companies to build a wind farm, hydroelectric power plant and other electricity-related infrastructures that are based on renewable energy in remote areas.

The regulation will also allow these companies to directly sell the electricity to surrounding households, although Jonan did not elaborate further.

According to data from the National Development Planning Ministry (Bappenas), the 35,000 MW project has been progressing slowly with only 195 MW currently in operation as of September. Still, there are 8,215 MW in construction, 10,844 MW in procuring process and 7,640 MW in preparation stage at the same period.

The government is also trying to close the power purchase agreement for 9,790 MW.

Previous Energy Minister Sudirman Said had tipped a review of the widely-criticized 35,000 MW plan.
