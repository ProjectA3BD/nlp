Noble Group: Noble Group announced on Tuesday that it and Noble Group Holdings have launched an offer to exchange Nobleâ€™s US$400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6 per cent perpetual capital securities for US$25 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.5 per cent perpetual capital securities to be issued by New Noble. Holders are being invited to exchange each US$200,000 in principal amount of existing securities for US$12,500 in principal amount of new securities.

Noble said the proposed offer is aimed at returning value to existing securities holders, since if the proposed restructuring does not complete and the company is put through liquidation, existing security holders would very likely receive nothing and if at all, be entitled to a recovery after existing senior creditors have been paid completely.
