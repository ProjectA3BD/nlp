You can fly to the tropical Indonesian island of Bali for super cheap right now.

Round-trip flights start at $423 from major cities on the East and West Coasts.

These majorly discounted tickets are for travel between August and November 2018 and between January and March of 2019.

Many of the flights are on award-winning airline EVA Air — known for its Hello Kitty-themed planes

This summer, travelers can fly to the idyllic Indonesian island of Bali starting at $423 round-trip, from major cities on the East and West Coasts.

Scott's Cheap Flights first uncovered the rare, cheap flights last night — and unlike most steeply discounted seats, they're on sale with a five-star airline.

According to the fare alert, the low-priced tickets can be found on flights between August and November, and again from January until March of 2019.

Generally, the flights are selling for approximately $566 round-trip from San Francisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles — and they can be purchased on the award-winning EVA Air (an airline best known for its Hello Kitty-themed jets and collectible Rimowa amenity kits).

Travel + Leisure also found that the sale extended to the East Coast. At press time, $423 round-trip flights could be purchased from New York City, though these tickets are for flights with the admittedly less-glamorous China Eastern Airlines, and include long layovers in Shanghai.

To book flights from your home airport to Bali, use a flexible low-fare calendar with either KAYAK or Momondo. The most inexpensive tickets will be listed in green and easy to spot.
