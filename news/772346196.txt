Annual export growth in June was 11.47 percent, weaker than analysts' median forecast, with total export value at $13 billion. The forecast in the poll was for a growth of 17.53 percent.

But import growth was far below expectations in June, at 12.66 percent, compared with the poll's 31.31 percent. Imports during the month were worth $11.26 billion.

Central Statistics Agency (BPS) head Suhariyanto said there were fewer working days in June due to Idul Fitri holidays, which affected trade figures.
