BANDUNG, Indonesia, Sept. 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- With the aim of formulating a strategy in response to and in support of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative, the Chinese government's program to further develop commerce and trade with the countries of Southeast Asia as well as those that border the Indian Ocean, in tandem with constructing a platform for China's textile printing companies who seek to grow their business outside of the home market, 2017 Interdye Asia, hosted by Shanghai International Exhibition Co., Ltd., is scheduled to take place soon in Indonesia.

Interdye Asia has, during the last six years, successfully been held in India, Turkey, Indonesia and Vietnam, and, in the course of doing so, has become the ideal communication platform for dyes and chemicals companies looking to expand into international markets, transform themselves into global brands and improve their competitiveness on the world stage.

At the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit, Chinese and Indonesian leaders communicated their ideas on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative and the Global Maritime Axis concept, the Indonesian government's initiative to reinvigorate the country's identity as a maritime nation, placing Indonesia as one of the key trader nations along the new ocean-going trade route. The textile and garment industry, the most important industry in Indonesia, tops all others in output value, exports and employment, with an average annual growth rate of 13 per cent. Dyes and chemicals, a key component of textile production, are mainly imported into the country. China directly exports dyes to more than 130 countries and regions, among which, Indonesia consistently maintains first or second place in terms of export volume, sending 30,000 to 40,000 tons annually to the country and accounting for approximately 12 per cent of the total volume for the sector. During the 12th five-year plan period, from 2011 to 2015, China recorded an average growth rate of roughly 6 per cent in export volume of dyes to Indonesia. In addition, textile auxiliaries, organic pigments, printing pastes and inks also demonstrate great market potential in Indonesia.
