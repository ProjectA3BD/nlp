At the Grow Asia Hackathon 2018, we want to find solutions that will give smallholders in Indonesia’s palm oil ecosystem better access to information, credit, and services to improve their livelihood and drive more sustainable outcomes.

That’s where you come in.

Join us at the Pre-Hackathon Workshop (12 April) where you can learn about the palm oil ecosystem in Indonesia from ecosystem stakeholders like Grow Asia, Unilever, Bayer, andMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). Also, learn about the challenges the smallholder farmers face. Find out how you can create solutions to make a difference and create a positive impact on their livelihoods.

You can also meet like-minded innovators and entrepreneurs with whom you can collaborate at the Hackathon!
