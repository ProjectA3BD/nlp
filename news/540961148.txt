SINGAPORE'S non-oil domestic exports (NODX) continued to pick up in April from March but still tumbled from a year ago.

Month on month, NODX rose 4.5 per cent in April, picking up strongly from a 0.1 per cent rise in March, according to the latest data released by trade promotion agency International Enterprise Singapore.

But year on year, NODX fell 7.9 per cent in April after a 15.7 per cent plunge in March.

Shipments to all top 10 markets declined except those to the European Union and Hong Kong. Taiwan, South Korea and Indonesia were the biggest contributors to last month's NODX fall.

Electronic NODX extended its decline in April, shrinking 7.4 per cent after a 9.1 per cent decrease in the previous month. Non-electronic NODX fell 8.1 per cent following an 18 per cent drop in March.

Non-oil re-exports declined 2.8 per cent last month, easing from a 3 per cent fall in March.
