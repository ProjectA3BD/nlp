Comment from the Judge: TERRY ITO (Director, TV producer, TV personality, critic, author and actor)

“Just watching the commercial made me happy, which I think is the most important thing. You watch the video, and the product is presented. This made me want to purchase and keep the product in my house. The casting of the characters was also great. It was a wonderful piece.”
