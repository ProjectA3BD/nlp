"We will send a team to the US to negotiate so that the GSP facility is maintained," Oke Nurwan, director general of foreign trade at Indonesia's trade ministry, told reporters on Monday.

Under GSP, Indonesia gets reduced tariffs on about $2 billion worth of US exports, including some agricultural, textile and timber products, Shinta Widjaja Kamdani, deputy chairwoman of Indonesia's employers association, said in a statement.

Total exports to the US were $17.8 billion, data from Indonesia's trade ministry showed. Indonesia ran a $9.7 billion trade surplus with the United States last year.

Shinta said that keeping Indonesia in the GSP program would benefit small- and medium-sized companies as well as US consumers by "providing them good quality products with affordable prices" and also by diversifying US import dependence on other countries.

Indonesian policymakers met on Sunday to discuss the US-China trade war and the GSP review, and the cabinet on Monday was expected to discuss trade issues in the wake of a US-China trade war.

Also on Monday, Indonesia's central bank governor Perry Warjiyo said such a trade war would hurt Indonesia and other economies.

Indonesia would respond by strengthening domestic demand, controlling its current account deficit and attracting capital inflows, he said.
