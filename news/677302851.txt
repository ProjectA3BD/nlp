TO stay relevant in a challenging food and beverage (F&B) market in Singapore, TungLok Restaurants will be leveraging on its healthy balance sheet to explore suitable investment opportunities that can add value to its business.

The group said in a Singapore Exchange filing on Monday morning that it has accelerated efforts "to refresh dining concepts and streamline operations with a view to optimising costs while delivering differentiated values to customers".

To drive further growth, TungLok will focus on the following strategies: rolling out promising brands to new geographical markets to reduce overdependence on Singapore, currently its key market; expand services and capabilities to offer greater convenience and choice to consumers in Singapore with an eye on younger diners; and streamline operations further through innovation, automation and other efforts to promote productivity at kitchen and service levels.

TungLok achieved a successful turnaround in FY2015 and was profitable in FY2016 and FY2017, it said.
