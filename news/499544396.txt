PROPERTY developer OKH Global on Tuesday said its CEO and executive chairman has had an Interpol notice issued against him.

The Red Notice from Interpol stated, among other things, that Bon Ween Foong is wanted by Indonesian authorities in connection with a charge of "providing false statement for official document", OKH Global said.

Interpol notices are international requests for cooperation or alerts allowing police in member countries to share critical crime-related information, the world's largest international police organisation said on its website.

With Red Notices, Interpol is seeking out individuals who are wanted by national jurisdictions for prosecution or to serve a sentence based on an arrest warrant or court decision. Interpol assists the national police forces in identifying and locating these persons with a view to their arrest and extradition or similar lawful action, it said.

"Mr Bon has advised the company that he believes that the Red Notice has arisen out of a commercial dispute that started in 2012 between Mr Bon (in his personal capacity) and a former business partner in Indonesia, in connection with a company known as PT Alliancz Asia Pacific."

The company said it understands that the dispute between Mr Bon and his former business partner involved, among other things, police reports being filed and legal proceedings being commenced in Indonesia.

"Mr Bon has advised the company that he vehemently denies the charge referred to in the Red Notice. Mr Bon will be represented by lawyers in Indonesia to contest the charge."

OKH Global said it is not related to and has no interest in PT Alliancz Asia Pacific and is not involved in that dispute.
