Jakarta. Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said on Wednesday (14/02) that Indonesia-Singapore relations have made significant progress after a meeting with her Singaporean counterpart, Vivian Balakrishnan, in Jakarta.

"We have well-measured bilateral cooperation, and from what we can see we realize thereâ€™s been significant progress in our relations," Retno said.

The countries are in the midst of ongoing negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty and a double taxation agreement. On the former, officials are scheduled to conduct a scoping exercise in Yogyakarta near the end of February.
