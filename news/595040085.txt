Jakarta. Indonesia's economic growth is expected to have cooled in the third quarter due to slow private investment and a cut in government spending, indicating that Southeast Asia's largest economy is struggling to mount a strong rebound.

The median forecast of 12 analysts in a Reuters poll was for gross domestic product growth of 5.04 percent in July-September year-on-year, below the 5.18 percent reported for the previous quarter. The data is due on Monday, Nov. 7.

Indonesia's central bank has slashed its benchmark policy rate six times this year, by a total of 150 basis points, in an effort to lift growth.
