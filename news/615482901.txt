The decree rules that a multinational group with annual consolidated turnover of not less than 11 trillion rupiah ($822.74 million) must prepare what the tax office called a country-by-country report, on top of some files on local businesses.

The report should detail how much tax the group pays in each country in which it operates, what kind of business it does, its turnover, balance sheets and global structure, the regulation says.

The group must also prepare what the tax office called a master file and a local file, which should include its Indonesian companyâ€™s structure, business activity, assets, and other financial files that can explain its transactions.

The documents can be kept by the firm, but must be made available to authorities upon request, Hutagaol said.

He said hundreds of multinational companies operating in Indonesia would be impacted by the rules, which took effect at the beginning of 2017.

The country-by-country documentation of transfer pricing is endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as part of an action plan for combating practices of base erosion and profit shifting.

As of Dec. 7, 2016, the OECD said 50 countries, including emerging markets like Brazil, China, India and South Africa, had signed agreements on exchange of such reports.

Indonesia is offering a tax amnesty programme to settle previous tax avoidance in exchange for some penalties. The programme ends in March.
