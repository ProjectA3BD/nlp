A volcanic ash cloud from Mount Agung has stopped flights in and out of the Indonesian island of Bali, disrupting the holiday plans of thousands.

Ngurah Rai international airport says all flights are suspended until at least 7pm local time (9pm AEST).

Jetstar says: “Due to a volcanic ash cloud caused by Mount Agung in Bali, it is currently not safe to operate flights to or from Denpasar Airport.”

Bali, a popular holiday destination for Australians, has been hit by a series of airport closures caused by volcanic ash.

An eruption at Mount Agung, about 70km from the coastal holiday area of Kuta, forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people last year.

Jetstar’s flights cancelled today include: JQ91 Denpasar to Cairns; JQ117 Singapore – Denpasar – Perth.

Other airlines disrupted include Virgin, Air Asia and Garuda.

Jetstar says it will contact passengers with new flight details when it is safe to resume flying. “Please do not manually re-book your flights,” says Jetstar.

Garuda says affected passengers should contact the 24-hour Contact Centre at 08041-807-807 or +62 21 2351 9999.
