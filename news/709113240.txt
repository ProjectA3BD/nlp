DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The "Indonesia's Rubber Industry Analysis 2017" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering.

Indonesia is the second largest natural rubber producer globally. The industry is currently experiencing oversupply with demand having slowed down, particularly from China which is the largest buyer of rubber in the world. Sumatra is the key natural rubber producing area in Indonesia accounting for two-thirds of the rubber latex harvested followed by Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Java. Close to 85% of the rubber producers in Indonesia are small holders, and they contribute 81% to the national output.

Indonesia was once the world's largest glove producer but currently the rubber manufacturer's base in the country has shrunk from 45 firms in 1989 to six firms. Indonesia produces approximately 51 million tyres per annum out of which 70% is exported primarily to the Middle East and North America. The regions Java and Sumatra are the largest contributors to the tyre market in the county. It is projected that the Indonesian tyre market will grow at a CAGR of approximately 13% during the period 2015-2020.
