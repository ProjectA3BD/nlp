An Australian journalist has been hit in the neck by stray bullet while reporting from the Philippine’s Marawi battle zone.

Adam Harvey is the ABC’s Indonesia correspondent, currently on the country’s southern island where troops are battling Islamic State militants.

An image of Harvey, published by CNN, shows him to be alert and being treated at the Amai Pakpak Medical Center.

He later posted this photo, showing that the bullet was still in his neck but he was “okay”.

Thanks everyone – I'm okay. Bullet is still in my neck, but it missed everything important. pic.twitter.com/PBYfdrTTa6 — Adam Harvey (@adharves) June 15, 2017

This x-ray shows it’s location with the caption: “Lucky”.

Last month president Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law on Mindanao after militants killed a police officer and two soldiers during fighting in Marawi, a city of 200,000 people that is predominantly Muslim.

As of May 30, local media reports that the death toll is at 104.

Here’s a look at Harvey’s coverage on Twitter of the brutal street war.
