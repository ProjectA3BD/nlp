Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdul Aziz doesn’t believe in travelling light.

The Washington Post has an extraordinary story about Salman’s upcoming visit to Indonesia, the first visit by a Saudi king to the nation in 46 years.

Salman’s international tours never fail to make headlines. In 2015, he and his 1000-person entourage caused the closure of a French Riviera beach for three days.

During that trip, a bizarre story emerged that a local mayor had complained because Salman’s group had poured concrete on the beach to install an elevator directly on the sand here, below the king’s private villa:

Indonesian officials might take note of that story, because a large chunk of Salman’s 495 tonnes of luggage comes in the form of two elevators.

Yes, you read that right – the Saudi king will be toting two electric elevators all the way to Indonesia.

And two Mercedes-Benz S600 limousines. Adji Gunawan of the airfreight company PT Jasa Angkasa Semesta told the Antara News Agency his company had 572 workers ready to control Salman’s luggage.

But if that sounds excessive, check out the full story at The Washington Post and details of what then US president Barack Obama lugged with him to sub-Sharan Africa in 2013.
