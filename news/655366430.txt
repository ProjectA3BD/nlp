In June 2013, The Guardian reported the first leak

based on top-secret documents that then-29-year-old Edward Snowden stole from the National Security Agency (NSA). At the time, Snowden worked as an intelligence contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii.

That leak would certainly not be the last. In the years since, more than 7,000 top secret documents have been released by journalists Snowden entrusted them to, which some believe is less than 1% of the entire archive.

Now, with the film “Snowden” premiering Friday, it’s worth taking a look back at what secrets he actually revealed. We’ve compiled every single leak that came out in the first year of the Snowden saga, though there were many more that came later.

Snowden allegedly downloaded up to 1.5 million files before jetting from Hawaii to Hong Kong to meet with journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. After he handed off his treasure-trove of documents, he flew from Hong Kong and later became stranded in Moscow. His future was far from certain as the journalists he trusted started revealing his secrets.

Author’s note: I’ve tried my best to be thorough in sifting through the hundreds of leaks that have come to light thus far. I have not included Snowden’s movements, legal situation, or any of the political drama surrounding the leaks. This timeline only shows the many reports stemming from documents the 30-year-old ex-NSA contractor handed over to journalists.

If I have missed any leaks in the hundreds of news stories on these items, that mistake is mine alone.

This post relied upon a similar timeline from Al Jazeera America, as well as a catalogue at Lawfare Blog, and an article at the National Journal.
