DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Indonesia's Rubber Industry Analysis 2016" report to their offering.

The report Indonesia's Rubber Industry Analysis 2016' highlights key dynamics ofIndonesia's rubber sector. The potential of the sector has been investigated along with the key challenges. The current market scenario and future prospects of the sector has also been studied.

Indonesia is the second largest natural rubber producer globally. The industry is currently experiencing oversupply with demand having slowed down particularly from China which is the largest buyer of rubber in the world. Sumatra is the key natural rubber producing area in Indonesia accounting for two-thirds of the rubber latex harvested followed by Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Java. 85% of the rubber producers are smallholders and they contribute 81% to the national output.

Actively supporting the sector, the International Rubber Consortium, which is a body representing rubber producers Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, has recently recommended the commodity not be sold at the current low prices. Indonesian rubber plantations grew from 3.62 million hectares in 2015 to 3.64 million hectares in 2016. In the same period, the productivity of the rubber plantations grew from 1.04 ton per hectare to 1.05 ton per hectare. There may be a marginal reduction in rubber production in 2016 due to the long dry spell in the second half of 2015. However, no other disruptions are expected in 2016.
