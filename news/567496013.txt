The Green Productivity Training for Consultants and Trainers (GP ToT) this year was held by Asian Productivity Organisation (APO) from 4 – 22 July in Taipei. The training was conducted by China Productivity Centre (CPC) of Taiwan which is co-hosting the Centre of Excellence on Green Productivity for Asia Pacific with APO, and supported by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (ROC).

The Managing Director of VisionEdge Technologies and GAC Ventures, Mr. Patrick Chan, represented Singapore at the nomination of SPRING Singapore and attended the training session together with 21 other participants from a mix of national productivity organizations, training institutes and consulting firms across 14 other countries including Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of China, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.

Green Productivity or GP, as a business and industry practice championed by APO since 1990s, addresses both productivity and sustainability needs, so that environmental and business performance gains can be achieved simultaneously with increased efficiency, material and cost savings, and therefore profitability.

The training covered a broad range of topics including

· Green Productivity (GP) Methodology, Tools & Techniques

· Green Productivity Diagnosis

· Material Flow Cost Analysis (MFCA) and ISO14051

· GP options e.g. 5S, 7W, 3R, Kaizan

· Green Factory

· Waste Recycling

· Clean Production

· Resource Recycling

· Green Energy

· Green Supply Chain

· Ishikawa/Fish-bone Diagram

· SWOT and Cross SWOT Analysis

The MFCA is a major tool under GP that traces and quantifies the flows and stocks of materials within an organization in physical and monetary units. It is not only applicable to large companies, but also SMEs, including service industries besides manufacturing firms. Any organizations in any sectors handling or consuming materials, energy or water can gain considerable benefits from MFCA.

The training covered in depth case studies, model company visit as well as case study company visits and consultancy studies, culminating in a 1.5 hour team presentation to company management on the study teams’ recommendations to help companies tap on GP and MFCA for both environmental performance, productivity improvement (through greater material/energy efficiency and cost reduction) and top & bottom-line improvement.

The training was conducted based on “Training the Trainers and Consultants” so trainers are expected to go back to their respective countries after the course to transfer knowledge and help in capacity building in GP and assist companies in their GP implementation. They will go back to their countries and work with business, industry and government partners in organizing seminars, workshops and conduct studies that will help in raising awareness, capacity building and knowledge transfer, consultancy project studies and implementation for companies, etc.

Mr. Patrick Chan was elected the class representative by his cohorts and selected at the end of the course as one of the best course participants who had demonstrated leadership and potential in green productivity training and consultancy.

Patrick is a Practising Management Consultant (PMC) and a PMC (Bilingual) accredited by Singapore Business Advisors and Consultants Council (SBACC) and also an accredited trainer under Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) Advanced Certificate in Training and Assessment (ACTA).
