Bali, Indonesia was the host to the 8th Annual Global CSR Summit & Awards 2016 on 21th April 2016 at Laguna Bali Report, Indonesia.

The Global CSR Summit & Awards is a prestigious international award event for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This year, the organisers have incorporated a new dimension into the Global CSR Summit by co-locating a new event, The Global Good Governance Award.

The Global CSR Summit & Awards 2016 was started 8 years ago. The event aims to create a Global Standard event to raise awareness on CSR as well as to have a prestigious awards recognition event to honour outstanding individuals and companies around the world for their contributions in environment preservation, community transformation and poverty alleviation, women’s rights and welfare, workplace practices and product innovations in CSR.

Since then, the event has grown from strength to strength and attracted a strong following of over 200 global and regional companies. The Global CSR Summit & Awards has become known as a global brand for raising cutting-edge ideas and topics on societal transformation, product innovations that change the world and controversial topics that aim to inspire bold ideas to drive large scale changes and improvements to the environment, people and the planet.

Melvin Chan, Founder of The Global CSR Summit & Awards commented: “The Global CSR Summit & Awards has withstood the test of time and is supported by respected companies from around the world including some of the Fortune 500 companies. The standards of this event have been raised higher to lead the practice in not accepting sponsorships from companies that want to submit their nominations for the awards. This sets us apart from all the other competing events in this space. Despite this, participation from companies have remained strong which is a strong endorsement to the high moral ethics that this event holds.”

Over 200 senior executives from multinational and leading corporations in Asia attended the event and witnessed the awards presentation graced by guest of honour Mr Dicky Edwin Hindarto, Head of Indonesia Joint Carbon Credit Mechanism Secretariat. The winners were adjudged by a panel of judges which included Mr Sreenivas Narayanan, Group MD for ASSIST Asia, Mr Geoff Shephard, Operations Director, World Vision Indonesia, Mr Tommy Pacatang, Chief Operating Officer, Habitat for Humanity Indonesia, Dr Geoffrey Williams, Managing Partner, William Consultancy Sdn Bhd and Mr Kusuma Adinugroho, World Bank of Timor Leste.

Out of 200 entries received from all over the world, a final selection of 42 companies were awarded top honours in the 7 main award categories, namely: Best Community Programme, Best Environmental Excellence, Excellence in Provision of Literacy & Education, Empowerment of Women, Best Workplace Practices, Product Excellence and CSR Leadership and 4 main award categories for the Global Good Governance Awards namely Best CEO Award, Best CFO Award, Best Corporate Communication Award and Best Governed and Most Transparent Award.

The award ceremony was held after the conference & exhibition which witnessed over 30 international speakers presenting best practices in CSR.
