"This project is crucial to provide alternative transportation between Jakarta and Surabaya. With Jakarta-Surabaya in six hours, or Jakarta-Semarang in three, the railway will be able to compete with airlines," Budi said.

Today, the 727-kilometer journey is a two-hour flight, while by train it takes at least nine hours.

Djoko Setijowarno, a transportation expert from Soegijapranata Catholic University in Salatiga in Central Java, said the high-speed rail project would ease the air traffic congestion over the northern coast of Java.

"Trains are an interesting alternative for passengers, because they offer point-to-point journeys, directly to the city centers," Djoko said.

Since Indonesia has been working on the project with Japan, Budi is going to meet his Japanese counterpart in Jakarta on Thursday (29/12). They will also discuss a deep-sea port development in Patimban, West Java.

"We hope the construction will start by the end of [next] year," Budi said.

Maritime Affairs Coordinating Minister Luhut Pandjaitan was in Tokyo last week to discuss the Jakarta-Surabaya project with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). He said the government hopes the project will not rely on funds from Indonesia's state budget.
