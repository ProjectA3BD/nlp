A missing Indonesian woman was discovered to have been swallowed by a python.

She was found by villagers inside the belly of the 23-foot snake.

This isn’t the first time an Indonesian villager has been swallowed by a snake.

An Indonesian woman named Wa Tiba, 54, went missing after heading out to visit her cornfield in Muna Island on Thursday night.

When Tiba didn’t return by the morning, her sister went to look for her. All she could find was Tiba’s footprints, flashlight, machete and slippers, the village chief, Faris, told the Associated Press.

The next morning, about 100 villagers joined in the search. Near her belongings, they found a 23-foot-long python that was so bloated it could barely move. The villagers killed the snake and cut it open with a machete.

"When they cut open the snake’s belly they found Tiba’s body still intact with all her clothes," Faris told the Associated Press. "She was swallowed first from her head."

The type of snake that killed Tiba was a reticulated python, which are widespread in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. To kill their prey, they grab onto it with their curved teeth and squeeze it to death before swallowing it whole, according to the Associated Press.

Attacks on humans are as rare as winning the lottery and being struck by lightning at the same time, says the Washington Post . However, this isn’t even the first time an Indonesian villager has been swallowed by a snake. Last year, a man on an adjacent island was extracted from a 23-foot-long python .
