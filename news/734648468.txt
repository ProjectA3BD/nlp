Billionaires view money differently than the average person – in more ways than one.

The typical billionaire could easily afford to spend $80 million each year, while most Americans earn less than $60,000.

We crunched the numbers and found the value of $1 for the average American equates to $1,355 for the typical billionaire.

Imagine if a trip to Bali cost you as much as a candy bar. Chances are you’d invite all your friends on vacation, and maybe even foot the bill.

That’s reality for the typical billionaire, relatively speaking.

The median household income in the US is $59,039 a year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. With only about 2,000 billionaires worldwide, it’s difficult for the rest of us to fathom the power wielded by a 10-figure net worth.

Business Insider crunched the numbers to see how the spending power of billionaires and average people compares on a dollar-to-dollar basis.

The median fortune of a Forbes list billionaire is about $2 billion. A conservative 4% annual withdrawal rate would bring their income to about $80 million a year.

At that rate, the value of $1 to the average person is the same as $1,355 to a billionaire. That means the stomach pinch you feel when you drop $100 on something is how a billionaire feels when they spend $135,500.
