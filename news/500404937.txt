[JAKARTA] Indonesia's central bank governor said the country's financial stability is its current priority amid the market sell-off in China and tumbling global oil prices.

Governor Agus Martowardojo also told reporters on Friday that Bank Indonesia will manage the exchange rate of the rupiah in a way that keeps it from being volatile.

"We have been able to maintain the rupiah stable. We had seen room to loosen monetary policy after our December meeting, but the world is uncertain now, we must prioritise stability,"he said.

Bank Indonesia will hold a two-day policy meeting on Jan 13 -14.
