JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia on Thursday urged Chinese ships not to enter its territorial waters, days after it protested against what it called a breach of its sovereignty by a Chinese coastguard ship.

"We will continue to maintain good relations with China without sacrificing Indonesia's sovereignty," said chief security minister Luhut Pandjaitan.

Foreign minister Retno Marsudi said on Thursday Indonesia was waiting for clarification from China over an incident last week involving a Chinese coastguard ship, a Chinese fishing vessel and Indonesian patrol boat in waters near the contested South China Sea.

China has said its vessels were operating in "traditional Chinese fishing grounds".
