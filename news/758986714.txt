Jakarta. Indonesia's competitiveness has dropped this year due to external pressures arising from trade, fluctuating exchange rates, and insufficient efforts to eradicate corruption, Switzerland-based International Institute for Management and Development, or IMD, revealed on Thursday (24/05).

Indonesia now ranks 43rd among 63 countries assessed for the World Competitiveness Yearbook ranking, down one place from the previous year.

Other countries showing signs of declining performance include Taiwan, Thailand, New Zealand and the Philippines, which fell seven places.
