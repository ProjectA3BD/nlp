President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, has taken steps to wean the country off commodities and push investment in value-added manufacturing and services to generate more jobs and to finance hundreds of billions of dollars needed for infrastructure. Indonesiaâ€™s economy has expanded at an average of about 5 percent, below the 7 percent target set by Jokowi when he came to power three years ago.
