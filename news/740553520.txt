Comments from Terry Ito

I was so excited and happy to participate in the GATSBY CREATIVE AWARDS. The Olympics are coming to Tokyo in 2020. Those Tokyo Olympics are a creative product of an older generation, but your turn to shine will come from 2021 on. Do whatever it takes to lead the way for Tokyo, for Japan, and for everyone in the world.
