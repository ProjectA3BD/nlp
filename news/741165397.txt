(RTTNews) - The European Union (EU) lifted import duties on biodiesel from Argentinean and Indonesian producers.

The EU considers the increasing shipments of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia as a threat to its local production. Therefore, it had established anti-dumping tariffs on these imports in 2013.

The European Court of Justice and the World Trade Organization posed against the measure of the European bloc. The EU had appealed the decision of the ECJ in September 2016, but withdrew the appeal this year, and the parties were notified in March.
