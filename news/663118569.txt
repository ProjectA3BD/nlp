Jakarta. Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves reached a record high of $124.95 billion at the end of May, $1.7 billion more than in April, Bank Indonesia said in a statement on Thursday (08/06).

The previous record of $124.6 billion was achieved in August 2011, when Indonesia and other commodity-based economies were enjoying the global commodities boom.

The reserves are enough to cover 8.9 months of imports or 8.6 months of imports and government foreign debt repayments, the central bank's spokesman Tirta Segara said in the statement.
