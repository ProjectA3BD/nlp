What is the architecture of happiness?



This issue, we look at Vietnamese architect Hoang Thuc Hao’s project, the National Happiness Centre in Bhutan, and his treatise on the subject. He explains architectural form as a geometric juxtaposition of circle and square, representing man-made and natural, and suggests that the balance between the two is a pathway to elevating the human spirit.



In recent decades, Vietnam, and in fact Asia, has seen a degradation in the quality of life. This is clearly a timely discussion. It reminds us of the importance of design as an instrument of ethics and a means to a better world.

At FuturArc we are proud to have championed the work and ideas of this activist-architect. And we hope to continue to report on his journey.

Other notables in this issue are the interview with Chitra Vishwanath, a pioneering advocate for sustainable design in India; two projects from China that examine the importance of socio-ecologic space in urban settings; and—at the other end of the scale—a microlibrary in Indonesia that elevates an existing public space with a small but exquisite structure.
