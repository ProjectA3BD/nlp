The rand weakened more than 2 percent on Friday, almost twice as much as any other major peer. That came hot on the heels of a slide in Brazilâ€™s real that defied the best efforts of the central bank. Even the Turkish lira was buckling again, losing more than 1 percent, less than 24 hours after policy makers surprised investors with a greater-than-forecast interest-rate increase. Sovereign bonds retreated and the MSCI index of emerging-market stocks fell the most in more than three weeks.
