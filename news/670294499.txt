On Tuesday (04/07), the director general of taxes, Ken Dwijugiasteadi, signed a joint agreement with Swiss Ambassador Yvonne Baumann on the information exchange to start in 2019.

"[What is] important for Indonesia is to be able to automatically exchange data with Switzerland, as the country is one of the world's biggest financial centers," a statement from the Directorate General of Taxes said.

Indonesia managed to make more than 900,000 taxpayers declare their previously unreported assets during he government's nine-month tax amnesty program. Most of the assets previously stashed abroad came from Singapore, Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong and Australia.

On June 16, the tax office signed a bilateral competent authority agreement with Hong Kong's Commissioner of Inland Revenue Department to gain access to Indonesian taxpayers' data in Hong Kong.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday the government is going to have similar agreements with other strategic countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia.

The agreements are now possible after the government issued a regulation in May, scraping bank secrecy in an effort to comply with the global Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) framework to prevent large-scale tax evasion.
