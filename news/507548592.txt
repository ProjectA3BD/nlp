BENSALEM, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Law Offices of Howard G. Smith announces an investigation on behalf of investors of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ("Freeport-McMoRan" or the "Company") (NYSE: FCX) concerning the Company and its officers’ alleged lack of internal controls and potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Injured investors with losses of $500,000 are encouraged to contact the Law Offices of Howard G. Smith to discuss their legal rights.

On January 19, 2016, following an investigation concerning allegations of corruption and bribery between the Company and government officials to secure lucrative mining rights, the chief executive officer of the Company’s Indonesian unit, Maroef Sjamsuddin, stepped down. This news came less than a month after the chairman of Freeport-McMoRan resigned allegedly due to similar charges. Following these news reports, shares of the Company’s stock fell in value, thereby damaging investors.

If you purchased Freeport-McMoRan securities and have suffered a loss, or if you have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Howard G. Smith, Esquire, of Law Offices of Howard G.
